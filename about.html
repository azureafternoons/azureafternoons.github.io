<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    <strong>Azure Afternoons</strong> in a independent initiative inside Microsoft. The idea is simple: "What if we (Cloud Solution Architects) 
    do document technical presentations/dicussions we have with our customers all around the world in a single repository over Github?" So, this
    is the answer.

    There is nothing really especial with this website except by the fact that we're pulling together a very useful content. Especially because it comes from the field,
    meaning that it comes from customers needs all around the World. It is just a compilation of content (presentations, videos, demos, live presentations, and scenarios
    discussions) whereby another customers, partners and independent professionals can take advantage of to build their own knowledge base.
